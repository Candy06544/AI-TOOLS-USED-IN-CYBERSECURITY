# AI Tools in Cybersecurity

This README file provides an overview of various **AI tools** that are commonly used to enhance cybersecurity. These tools use **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to detect and respond to cyber threats like malware, phishing attacks, and network intrusions. These tools are not specific to one platform but are standalone tools or technologies that help secure systems and networks.

## What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. With the increasing number of cyberattacks, cybersecurity tools are essential to ensure that data and systems remain safe.

## What is AI in Cybersecurity?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity refers to using advanced algorithms and learning models to identify, predict, and prevent cyber threats. Instead of relying solely on traditional methods, AI tools can analyze vast amounts of data and make decisions in real-time. AI can detect unusual behavior, spot patterns of known attacks, and even respond autonomously to threats.

## AI Tools in Cybersecurity

### 1. **Snort (AI-Powered Intrusion Detection)**
- Snort is a free,customizable and open source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that monitor network traffic
- Inspects network packets(chunk of data with header,payload and trailer.Made  in the network layer of the OSI model)
  
  ### How it works :
-  Funtions by inspecting data packets that pass through a network through packet sniffing (Intercepting data packets that pass through a network)
-  anlyzes the data packets for known attack signatures from know malware attack 
  ###  Intrusion detection with snort:
  -Snort can work in three ways:
  ###  sniffer mode :
- Captures and displays network packets in real time
  ###  Packet logger mode:
- Snort logs packtes to afile allowing you to analyze them later this helps with forensic investigation.
  ###  Network Intrusion detection mode:
- Compares network traffic against a database of known attack signatures.
